### **Final Thoughts**

By breaking each feature down into smaller tasks, you can easily track your progress and focus on one specific aspect at a time. I recommend following the sequence of tasks as you build the website step-by-step. Some features may overlap, so it’s okay to adjust the order based on your development speed.
